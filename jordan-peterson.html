                                    In 1999, Routledge published Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, 
                                    in which Peterson describes a comprehensive theory about how people construct meaning, 
                                    form beliefs, and make narratives. The book, which took Peterson 13 years to complete, 
                                    draws concepts from various fields including mythology, religion, literature, philosophy, 
                                    and psychology, in accordance to the modern scientific understanding of how the brain functions.

                                        In January 2018, Penguin Random House published Peterson's second book, <span>12 Rules for Life: 
                                        An Antidote to Chaos</span>, in which self-help principles are discussed in a more accessible 
                                        style than in his previous published work. The book topped best-selling lists 
                                        in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the US, and the United Kingdom.

                        Peterson has characterized himself politically as a "classic British liberal" and a "traditionalist". 
                        He has stated that he is commonly mistaken as right-wing. The New York Times described Peterson as 
                        "conservative-leaning", and The Washington Post described him as an "aspiring conservative thought leader."
                        Yoram Hazony wrote in The Wall Street Journal that "the startling success of his elevated arguments 
                        for the importance of order has made him the most significant conservative thinker to appear in the 
                        English-speaking world in a generation." Wall Street Journal editorial page writer Barton Swaim 
                        wrote, "I wouldn't describe [Peterson] as a conservativeâ€”his interest lies in individual rather 
                        than societal order, and he says little about public policy. But it's true that he not infrequently 
                        winds up holding conservative viewpoints on cultural matters." The American Conservative wrote 
                        that, while Peterson has "abjured any connection to modern liberalism or conservatism... the biggest tell 
                        that Peterson is a conservative is simply that his general disposition toward life and society is conservative." 
                        In the Los Angeles Times, libertarian journalist Cathy Young commented that "Peterson's ideas are a mixed bag."
                        Nathan J. Robinson of the left-wing magazine Current Affairs writes that Peterson has been seen 
                        "as everything from a fascist apologist to an Enlightenment liberal, because his vacuous words 
                        are a kind of Rorschach test onto which countless interpretations can be projected."
