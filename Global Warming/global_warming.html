                <p>
                    Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's climate system observed since 
                    the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily 
                    fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere. 
                    The term is frequently used interchangeably with the term climate change, though the latter refers 
                    to both human- and naturally produced warming and the effects it has on our planet. It is most commonly 
                    measured as the average increase in Earth's global surface temperature.

                <p>
                    Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have 
                    come to define Earth's local, regional and global climates. These changes have a 
                    broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term.

                    Changes observed in Earth's climate since the early 20th century are primarily driven by 
                    human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse 
                    gas levels in Earth's atmosphere, raising Earth's average surface temperature. These human-produced 
                    temperature increases are commonly referred to as global warming. Natural processes can also 
                    contribute to climate change, including internal variability (e.g., cyclical ocean patterns like 
                    El Niño, La Niña and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and external forcings (e.g., volcanic activity, 
                    changes in the Sun's energy output, variations in Earth's orbit).
