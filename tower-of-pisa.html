            <h2 id="Introduction">What is Tower of Pisa?</h2>
            <p>
                The Leaning Tower of Pisa (Italian: torre pendente di Pisa), or simply, 
                the Tower of Pisa, is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of Pisa Cathedral. 
                It is known for its nearly four-degree lean, the result of an unstable foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tower is one of three structures in the Pisa's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo),
                which includes the cathedral and Pisa Baptistry.

            <p>
                The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which 
                could not properly support the structure's weight. It worsened through the completion of 
                construction in the 14th century.

            <p>
                By 1990, the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees. The structure was stabilized by remedial work 
                between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees.

            <p>
                There has been controversy surrounding the identity of the architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
                For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano, a well-known 12th-century 
                resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo.
                Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. 
                A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be 
                related to the bronze door in the fa√ßade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. 
                A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and 
                affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.

                    During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. 
                    Leon Weckstein, a U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower, 
                    was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering 
                    an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep 
                    it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, 
                    the government of <span>Italy</span> requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, 
                    considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting 
                    the tourism industry of Pisa.

                        Starting in 1993, 870 tonnes of lead counterweights were added, which straightened the tower slightly.
